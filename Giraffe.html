Giraffes are the tallest land animals, renowned for their long necks and legs, which allow them to reach leaves high in the treetops. Native to various regions in Africa, they typically inhabit savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands. Their unique coat patterns, consisting of irregular patches that can vary in color, help with camouflage in the dappled light of their environment. Giraffes are social creatures, often found in loose herds, and communicate through a range of vocalizations, as well as body language. They are primarily browsers, feeding on acacia and other tree leaves, and their specialized digestive systems help them efficiently process fibrous plant material. Giraffes play a vital role in their ecosystem by aiding in seed dispersal and maintaining the health of their habitats.
