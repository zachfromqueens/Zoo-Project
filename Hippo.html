Hippos, or Hippopotamus amphibius, are large, semi-aquatic mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa. They are known for their massive size, with adult males weighing between 3,000 to 4,000 pounds. Hippos spend much of their day submerged in water to keep cool, emerging at night to graze on grasses. Despite their bulky appearance, they can run surprisingly fast on land, reaching speeds of up to 19 miles per hour. Hippos are highly territorial, especially in water, and can be aggressive when threatened. They communicate through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts and wheezes, and play a crucial role in their ecosystem by maintaining waterway health. However, they are also considered one of the world's most dangerous animals due to their unpredictable nature and strong jaws.
