<h1>Lions</h1>

<p>
Lions, known scientifically as *Panthera leo*, are majestic big cats primarily found in the savannas and grasslands of Africa, with a small population in India’s Gir Forest. They are the only truly social big cats, living in groups called prides, which typically consist of related females, their cubs, and a coalition of males. Adult males are easily recognizable by their impressive manes, which vary in color and size, serving as a display of strength and health. Lions are apex predators, primarily hunting large herbivores like zebras and wildebeests, and they often hunt in coordinated groups to increase their success. Despite their reputation as "kings of the jungle," they are facing significant threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, leading to a decline in their populations across many regions.
