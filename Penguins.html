<p>
Penguins are flightless birds primarily found in the Southern Hemisphere, with the largest populations in Antarctica. Known for their distinctive black and white plumage, they are exceptional swimmers, using their wings as flippers to propel themselves underwater in search of fish and krill. Penguins are social creatures, often living in large colonies where they engage in various behaviors such as mating rituals and communal parenting. There are 18 species of penguins, each with unique adaptations to their environments, ranging from the Emperor Penguin, the largest, to the small Little Blue Penguin. Their playful demeanor and waddling gait make them beloved by many.

<p><b>Fun fact: </b>A group of pengiuns are called different things depending on where they
are.<br>A group on land is called a "waddle" and a group in the water are called a "raft". <br>Don't try to float on them though!.</p>
