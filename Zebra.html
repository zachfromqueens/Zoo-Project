Zebras are distinctive, striped herbivores native to Africa, known for their striking black-and-white coats that help with camouflage and social interactions. 
They belong to the horse family, Equidae, and primarily inhabit grasslands and savannas. Zebras are social animals, often found in herds, which provide protection against predators. Their stripes are unique to each individual, much like human fingerprints, and play a role in identification among members of a group. Additionally, zebras are known for their vocalizations, which include barks, whinnies, and snorts, allowing them to communicate effectively with one another. These fascinating animals are also important for their ecosystem, as they graze on grasses, helping to maintain the balance of their habitats.
